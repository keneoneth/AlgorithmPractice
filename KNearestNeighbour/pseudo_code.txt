steps:
1. Load the training and test data 
2. Choose the value of K 
3. For each point in test data:
       - find the Euclidean distance to all training data points
       - store the Euclidean distances in a list and sort it 
       - choose the first k points 
       - assign a class to the test point based on the majority of classes present in the chosen points
4. End
